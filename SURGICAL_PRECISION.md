# MFR Surgical Precision Verification

This document verifies and documents how Mass Find Replace (MFR) operates with surgical precision, preserving everything in files except for the exact strings being replaced.

## The Iron Rule

**MFR must operate surgically when replacing strings in filenames, folder names, or lines of text inside files. Every other part of the file must be left intact, including trailing spaces and line ending formats, or even illegal unicode chars. Everything must be left exactly as it was found, except for those strings from the replacement_mapping.json.**

## Verification Results âœ…

Our comprehensive test suite confirms that MFR:

### 1. **Preserves Line Endings Exactly**
- Windows line endings (`\r\n`) remain `\r\n`
- Unix line endings (`\n`) remain `\n`
- Mac Classic line endings (`\r`) remain `\r`
- Mixed line endings within the same file are preserved exactly as found

### 2. **Preserves All Whitespace**
- Trailing spaces at the end of lines
- Trailing tabs
- Multiple consecutive spaces
- Mixed tabs and spaces
- Empty lines with various whitespace combinations

### 3. **Preserves Unicode and Special Characters**
- Emoji and other Unicode symbols (ðŸŽ‰, ðŸš€, etc.)
- Control characters (`\x01`, `\x02`, etc.)
- Non-breaking spaces (`\xa0`)
- All valid Unicode remains intact

### 4. **Handles Files with Invalid Encoding**
- Files with invalid UTF-8 sequences are detected as binary
- Binary files are NOT modified (to prevent corruption)
- Matches in binary files are logged to `binary_files_matches.log`

### 5. **Preserves File Structure**
- Files without final newlines remain without final newlines
- Empty lines are preserved exactly
- Very long lines (>5000 characters) are handled correctly

## Technical Implementation

### File Reading
```python
with open(filepath, "r", encoding=file_encoding, errors="surrogateescape", newline="") as f:
```
- `errors="surrogateescape"`: Preserves invalid byte sequences
- `newline=""`: Prevents line ending conversion

### File Writing
```python
with open(filepath, "w", encoding=file_encoding, errors="surrogateescape", newline="") as f:
```
- Same parameters ensure exact byte preservation

### Line Processing
- `splitlines(keepends=True)`: Preserves line endings when splitting
- Each line is processed independently
- Only the matched strings are replaced, nothing else

## Test Suite

The `test_surgical_precision.py` file verifies:
- Trailing spaces preservation
- Mixed line endings preservation
- Unicode character preservation
- Tab/space preservation
- Files without final newlines
- Empty lines preservation
- Very long lines handling
- Binary file detection

All tests pass, confirming MFR's surgical precision.

## Conclusion

MFR successfully implements the iron rule of surgical precision. It modifies ONLY the strings specified in the replacement mapping, leaving everything elseâ€”including formatting, whitespace, line endings, and special charactersâ€”completely intact.
