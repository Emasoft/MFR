# UV Build Configuration Summary

## Current Status: ✅ Properly Configured

The project's `uv build` configuration has been reviewed and updated based on the official uv documentation. Here's the current setup:

### Build System Configuration

**Build Backend**: Hatchling (recommended default)
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

**Why Hatchling?**
- Mature and well-maintained build backend
- Supports src layout (which we use)
- Handles entry points and metadata properly
- No need for uv's preview build backend since we don't have extension modules

### Package Structure

**Layout**: src layout
```
project-root/
├── src/
│   └── mass_find_replace/    # Package source
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── file_system_operations.py
│       ├── mass_find_replace.py
│       └── replace_logic.py
├── tests/
├── pyproject.toml
├── uv.lock
└── dist/                     # Build output
```

### Build Configuration

**Hatchling Configuration**:
```toml
[tool.hatch.build]
# Configure source directory
sources = ["src"]

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
# Configure wheel to include the package from src directory
sources = ["src"]

[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]
include = [
    "src/mass_find_replace/**/*.py",
    "tests/**/*.py",
    "replacement_mapping.json",
    "requirements.txt",
    "requirements-dev.txt",
    "README.md",
    "LICENSE",
]
```

**UV Configuration**:
```toml
[tool.uv]
# Ensure package is built properly
package = true
```

### Entry Points

Properly configured console scripts:
```toml
[project.scripts]
mfr = "mass_find_replace.mass_find_replace:main_cli"
mass-find-replace = "mass_find_replace.mass_find_replace:main_cli"
```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build both sdist and wheel (default)
uv build

# Build only source distribution
uv build --sdist

# Build only wheel
uv build --wheel

# Build with specific output directory
uv build --out-dir ./custom-dist/
```

### Build Output

The build creates:
1. **Source Distribution**: `mass_find_replace-0.3.0a0.tar.gz`
   - Contains source code and metadata
   - Can be built into a wheel on target system

2. **Wheel**: `mass_find_replace-0.3.0a0-py3-none-any.whl`
   - Binary distribution ready for installation
   - Includes compiled bytecode
   - Platform-independent (pure Python)

### Verification Steps Completed

✅ Build executes without errors
✅ Source distribution includes all necessary files
✅ Wheel includes Python modules correctly
✅ Entry points are properly configured
✅ Package installs successfully with `uv pip install`
✅ Console scripts (mfr, mass-find-replace) work after installation
✅ All linters pass after configuration changes

### Best Practices Implemented

1. **Using src layout** - Prevents import confusion during development
2. **Pinned Python version** - `.python-version` file specifies Python 3.11
3. **Lockfile committed** - `uv.lock` ensures reproducible builds
4. **Proper metadata** - All required project metadata in pyproject.toml
5. **Entry points** - Multiple console script names for user convenience

### Notes

- We're not using uv's preview build backend since it's in preview and we don't need its features
- This is a single-package project, not a workspace (no need for workspace configuration)
- The package is pure Python (no extension modules), making distribution simpler
- Build constraints and hash verification can be added if needed for security

The configuration follows uv's best practices and successfully builds distributable packages.
