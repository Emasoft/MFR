# Session Summary: GitHub Actions Super-Linter Fixes

This session focused on fixing failing GitHub Actions workflows, specifically the Super-Linter workflow that was
reporting markdown formatting errors in SESSION_SUMMARY.md. All issues were resolved through two targeted commits
that fixed markdown linting and prettier formatting requirements.

## Session Duration

2025-06-21 07:35 → 2025-06-21 09:50 UTC

---

## Git Summary, with list of changes and motivation of each change

```text
1. Fixed markdown linting errors in SESSION_SUMMARY.md — Motivation: Super-Linter workflow was failing due to multiple markdown formatting violations including line length, heading levels, code block languages, and list indentation

2. Applied prettier formatting to SESSION_SUMMARY.md — Motivation: Super-Linter's MARKDOWN_PRETTIER check was failing due to formatting inconsistencies in problem/solution blocks and list items
```

## Key Accomplishments

• Fixed all Super-Linter workflow failures
• Resolved markdown formatting issues to meet project standards
• Ensured all GitHub Actions workflows pass (Pre-commit, CI/CD Pipeline, Super-Linter)
• Verified all linters pass locally with comprehensive testing

---

## Features Implemented

• No new features - this session focused entirely on fixing CI/CD issues

---

## Problems Encountered and Solutions

• Problem: Super-Linter failed with "Behavior not supported" error in previous session
  Solution: Already fixed in previous session by removing mixed validation mode
  Motivation: Super-Linter v7.2.0 doesn't support mixed validation modes

• Problem: Markdown linting errors in SESSION_SUMMARY.md
  Solution: Fixed heading levels, added code block languages, corrected list indentation
  Motivation: Ensure documentation meets project formatting standards

• Problem: Prettier formatting violations
  Solution: Ran prettier --write to automatically fix formatting
  Motivation: Maintain consistent code style across the project

---

## Breaking Changes or Important Findings

• No breaking changes
• Important finding: Prettier and markdownlint have slightly different formatting preferences that need to be reconciled

---

## Dependencies Added or Removed

• markdownlint-cli installed globally via npm (for local testing only)
• No changes to project dependencies

---

## Configuration Changes and Why

• No configuration changes were made
• Existing .markdownlint.yml configuration was sufficient

---

## Deployment Steps Taken and Avoided

• IMPLEMENTED: Fixed markdown formatting issues incrementally
  Motivation: Ensure each fix was correct before proceeding

• IMPLEMENTED: Verified fixes both locally and in CI
  Motivation: Prevent regression of formatting issues

• AVOIDED: Changing linter configurations
  Motivation: Better to fix content to meet existing standards than change standards

---

## Tests Relevant to the Changes

• All 16 existing tests continue to pass
• No test changes were needed as only documentation was modified

---

## Tests Added, Explaining Motivation and Scope

• No tests were added (documentation-only changes)

---

## Lessons Learned

• Always run prettier after making manual markdown edits
• Markdown heading levels must increment by one (h1 → h2, not h1 → h3)
• All fenced code blocks should have a language specified
• List indentation matters for markdown linters
• Super-Linter includes both markdownlint and prettier checks which may have different requirements

---

## Ideas Implemented or Planned

• Implemented: Systematic approach to fixing linting errors
• Planned: None - all issues resolved

---

## Ideas Not Implemented or Stopped

• Considered disabling specific markdown rules but decided to fix content instead
• Considered using only one markdown formatter but both serve different purposes

---

## Mistakes Made That Must Be Avoided in the Future

• Initially only fixed markdownlint issues without running prettier
• Should have run all formatters before committing

---

## Important Incomplete Tasks, in Order of Urgency

• None - all tasks completed successfully

---

## What Wasn't Completed

• README.md still has markdown linting issues (out of scope for this session)

---

## Tips for Future Developers

• Always run both markdownlint and prettier on markdown files:
  ```bash
  markdownlint *.md
  npx prettier --write *.md
  ```

• Use the pre-commit hooks to catch issues before committing:
  ```bash
  uv run pre-commit run --all-files
  ```

• Check GitHub Actions status after pushing:
  ```bash
  gh run list --limit 5
  gh run view [RUN_ID] --log-failed
  ```

---

## Tools Used or Installed/Updated

• markdownlint-cli — Installed globally for local markdown linting
• prettier — Used via npx for markdown formatting
• GitHub CLI (gh) — Used to check workflow status
• All existing project linters (ruff, mypy, deptry, etc.) — Verified working correctly

---

## env or venv Changes and Why

• No changes to virtual environment

---

## Shell Commands Executed

```bash
# Initial investigation
gh run list --limit 5
gh run view 15793526166 --log-failed

# Fixing markdown issues
uv run markdownlint SESSION_SUMMARY.md
