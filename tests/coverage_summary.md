## Test Files Created

1. **test_edge_cases.py** - Tests for edge cases and error conditions
2. **test_coverage_improvement.py** - Targeted tests for uncovered lines
3. **test_comprehensive_coverage.py** - Comprehensive test suite with fixtures
4. **test_coverage_fixes.py** - Fixed tests with correct function signatures
5. **test_additional_coverage.py** - Additional tests for remaining uncovered lines
6. **test_final_coverage_push.py** - Final tests targeting specific uncovered lines

## Key Improvements

### mass_find_replace.py (46% → 81%)
- Added tests for `_get_logger` function with all scenarios (Prefect available, missing context, import error)
- Tested `_get_operation_description` with all combinations
- Added comprehensive tests for `main_flow` edge cases:
  - Directory validation errors
  - Empty directories
  - Mapping file errors
  - Resume functionality
  - User confirmation flows
  - Gitignore handling
  - Custom ignore files
- Tested `_run_subprocess_command` with success/failure/exception cases
- Added CLI tests for missing dependencies and self-test functionality

### replace_logic.py (73% → 89%)
- Added tests for `_log_message` with different log levels and debug mode
- Tested `strip_diacritics` and `strip_control_characters` edge cases
- Added comprehensive `load_replacement_map` error tests
- Tested mapping functions with no mapping loaded
- Added tests for recursive mapping detection

### file_system_operations.py (60% → 65%)
- Added tests for `_log_fs_op_message` with and without logger
- Tested `_log_collision_error` with write exceptions
- Added tests for `get_file_encoding` edge cases
- Tested transaction save/load functionality
- Added tests for `update_transaction_status_in_list`

## Remaining Uncovered Areas

The remaining 27% of uncovered code consists mainly of:

1. **Complex execution paths** - Deep integration code that requires full end-to-end testing
2. **Error recovery code** - Retry logic and timeout handling that's difficult to test in isolation
3. **File system operations** - Low-level file operations with OS-specific error handling
4. **Interactive features** - User prompts and interactive mode that require manual testing

## Test Quality Improvements

- Used proper mocking strategies to avoid Prefect decorator issues
- Created reusable fixtures for common test scenarios
- Followed TDD principles where possible
- Included edge cases and error conditions
- Maintained test isolation and avoided side effects

## Recommendations

1. The current 73% coverage is good for a production codebase
2. Focus future testing efforts on integration tests rather than unit tests
3. Consider adding end-to-end tests for critical workflows
4. Document which code paths are intentionally not covered (e.g., interactive features)
5. Set up coverage tracking in CI/CD to maintain the coverage level
