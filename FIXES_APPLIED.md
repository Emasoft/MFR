# Fixes Applied to MFR Codebase

## Summary
Fixed multiple code quality issues identified by comprehensive analysis. All tests pass and functionality remains unchanged.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Exception Handling Improvements
- **Fixed f-string in exception**: Changed `raise TimeoutError(f"...")` to assign message to variable first
- **Added exception chaining**: Changed `raise` to `raise from e` for better error context

### 2. File I/O Improvements
- **Replaced open() with Path.open()**: Updated 7 instances to use pathlib consistently
- **Combined nested with statements**: Changed nested `with` to single line for better readability

### 3. Code Structure Improvements
- **Removed unnecessary else/elif after return**: Fixed 8 instances (auto-fixed by ruff)
- **Removed unnecessary variable assignments**: Direct returns instead of assign-then-return
- **Replaced assert with proper exception**: Changed `assert isinstance()` to proper TypeError

### 4. Type Safety
- **Fixed comment about Iterator import**: Clarified it's used in implementation, not just types

## Files Modified
- `src/mass_find_replace/file_system_operations.py` - Main fixes applied here

## Verification
- All tests pass
- Pre-commit hooks pass
- No new errors introduced
- Code is more maintainable and follows best practices

## Remaining Issues (Non-Critical)
As documented in ISSUES_SUMMARY.md:
- File size violations (files exceed 10KB limit)
- Some missing docstrings
- Minor style issues

These can be addressed in future refactoring as outlined in REFACTORING_PLAN.md.
